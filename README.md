# ProPic :camera_flash:

A website called "ProPic", which takes normal profile pictures to the most creative and edit it the way you want it to be :tada:

## The Background Behind This Project :open_book:

I want to do a project that has a lot of the flexbox properties in it and focus on creating lots of different transitions and hover states :blush:

## What I learned :brain:

- The `flexbox` properties
- How to creat `box-shadow` around my images
- How to creat a navigationbar with flexbox
- Heavily focused on creating lots of different `transitions`
